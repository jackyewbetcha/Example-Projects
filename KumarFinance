This was a project I sold to someone way too cheaply. It hit nearly 70k marketcap, and just recently the dev ordered another token (Kumar 2, of all things) so
I had to update some info and I recently minted him a new token.

The first token is literally just a fork of a contract known as "PIG" but I didn't burn any of the total supply upon launch.

The second token (Kumar2) he wanted something deflationary, so I gave him a contract I found that burns 20% of every tx forever.
