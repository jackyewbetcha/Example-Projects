Tjoma: Someone asked me to make them a shitcoin on AVAX, fronted me some AVAX and we deployed this contract with no website.

It hit number 18 for a while. This contract is alot like the SakuraTree coin except that it doesn't have any maximum TX amount.

Swordfish Finance: Someone deployed a Lobster Finance coin, so one of his friends wanted me to fork it as a joke. 
The 'Lobster' contract was just PIG modified, neither Lobster nor Swordfish got much usage though so I don't 
consider this one very good or important. Just something quick.

This was posted for a DAO while I was just beginning to learn Solidity by forking it some from some obscure youtube video and never used it.
It has a bunch of exploits, and taught me indirectly how important chainlink was, because I learned very quickly RNG and solidity don't mix.
